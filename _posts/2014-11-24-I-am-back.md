I’ve long time thought about updating to a new blog engine and most of my thoughts has been around creating and hosting a custom one in Microsoft Azure. But with more and more of my work being done on [GitHub](https://github.com/) I thought why not put my blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) instead. Don't get me wrong, I love Azure and I love develop custom code, but writing my own blog enging?!?! Really?!?! It didn’t take me long to find and deploy [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and only seconds later I’m up and running. So here it is, my new blog.
